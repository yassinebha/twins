2014-01-13 12:16 Started a script (called twi_test_scrubbing_glm.m) to check if treating scrubbed volumes 
                 as missing data would have a big effect on the significance of statistical tests in the twins experiment. 
                 Specifically, I have grabbed the GLM results from mammouth, folder
                     /home/bellecp1/database/twins/stability_fir_all_sad_blocs_EXP2_test1/glm_fir_tmp/sci40_scg36_scf36/dominic_dep
                 as well as the preprocessed data (files *_extra.mat) located in 
                     /home/bellecp1/database/twins/fmri_preprocess_EXP2_test1/ 
                 This preprocessing was done *with* scrubbing (FD<0.5) and *with* non-uniformity correction on functional volumes
                     (it looks like this has a big impact). 
                 The GLM analysis was done while allowing for temporal interpolation of up to 60 seconds. See script in:
                     /home/bellecp1/database/twins/stability_fir_all_sad_blocs_EXP2_test1/glm_fir_tmp/twins_pipeline_fir_glm_EXP2_test1_tmp.m
                 By checking into the file glm_dominic_dep_sci40_scg36_scf36.mat, it looks like 219 subjects were included in the analysis, 
                     which means that roughly 80 subjects were excluded. 
2014-01-13 12:26 Just committed the script. At lines 26-30, we checked if the interpolation makes sense with the scrubbing mask.
                 It mostly does. There is clearly no shift in the way we extracted the masks. 
                 But it looks like the first point used to interpolate a window is the first scrubbed point, rather than the last 
                 non-scrubbed point. Weird. We don't care, as we're about to ignore interpolated points. But weird still.
2014-01-13 12:26 Added a couple of experiments (lines 33-72) to check the impact of scrubbing on an individual statistical test (here time point #33)
                 Main conclusion is that it does not change anything. 
                 Other potentially interesting findings:
                     1. including the squared dominic slightly increased the overall significance. 
                     2. the "control" group has been defined in an extremely stringent way (dominic<=1, which leaves less than 20 subjects)
                        With a less tringent definition, we would get almost 140 controls ...
                 I am committing the script now.
2014-01-13 13:48 So I added a few experiments to the script (I am about to commit it). 
                 Basically, doing the tests based on the two groups with one extended a lot does not produce any marked improvement.
                 Now, observing the curves, it does look like a lot of the effect is driven by what is going on at baseline. 
                 Which is used to normalize the FIR curve. 
                 So we switched to the idea of normalizing by the time points acquired during the neutral film.
                 Yassine is restarting an analysis with the new normalization, and extending the groups.
2014-01-13 14:26 commited timing file twins_timing_EXP2_test1_all_sad_blocs_neut_ref.csv. It indicate the time point of the only 
                 neutral blocks (not the fixation time)
                 I've used:      	onset 	 duration
                                  rest	27	15
				  rest	81	15
				  rest 	135	15
				  rest 	189	15
				  rest 	243	15
				  sad	291	246
2014-01-13 15:09 started glm_fir analysis (twins_pipeline_fir_glm_EXP2_test1_tmp.m) with the new normalization only, then I'll re-run it
                 with the extended dmominc R group controle. 
2014-01-13 15:40 commited  group model file "dominic_dep_group0a6_minus_group11a20.csv" ,It include controle subject from 0 to 6 dominic_dep 
                 score(199 subjects), and 11 to 20 for depressif subject (30 subjects)
2014-01-13 16:04 re-started glm_fir analysis (twins_pipeline_fir_glm_EXP2_test1_tmp.m) with the new normalization and the extended controlgroup using 
                 "dominic_dep_group0a6_minus_group11a20.csv" file
2014-01-13 16:33 commited  script "twins_pipeline_fir_glm_EXP2_test2.m". I removed familly regressor because Pierre  sead it dosn't make any sens to do it tha way.
2014-01-13 16:33 re-started glm_fir analysis (twins_pipeline_fir_glm_EXP2_test2.m), it's test2 _without scrubbing , baut I removed the family regrossors
2014-01-13 16:33 I chekd with Rkward if FD and dominic_dep are correlated. Method: pearson, Exclusion: pairwise.complete.obs. result r= -0.0151917 
                 p-values = 0.7936269. no correlation found
2014-01-13 17:33 I've startted th QC of the depressed subject that score from 11 to 19 im dominic_dep (30 subject).
2014-01-13 18:20 I've finished the QC for depressed subject, I will do the same for controle subjects that score from 0 to 6 in dominic_dep
